      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        It's unmistakable that we are driven by passion about giving you a holistic wedding service and giving our twitterpated couples more than they 
        expected throughout their wedding experience! We love spoiling you with the many thoughtful elements we have designed throughout our service! We certainly know the Stress of planning a wedding and having to coordinate so many elements to make a wedding day unforgettable and memorable. Unfortunately, that did not happen for us. Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong on our wedding day, culminating with the photographer running out of film (oops, did we just age ourselves:)?) and not getting any pictures of our wedding reception in pictures!! We had a great time in spite of all that, but would rather you did not have that kind of wedding experience
