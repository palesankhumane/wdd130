    <p>Hello everybody! My name is Palesa. I was born and raised in Mabopane (north of Pretoria), South Africa. I am new to anything technical with computers, so this is completely outside my comfort zone. I'm excited to learn new things and develop a new skill set. I have a degree in Financial Accounting and in Montessori Teaching. I can't claim that Accounting is a passion of mine but I absolutely love working with children. I am currently working towards a certificate in Computer Programming and Web Design. I am studying to earn a degree in Applied Technology</p>

    <p>I'm married to the love of my life, Momps, and we're in our 20th year of marriage. We were married in the Johannesburg, South Africa Temple. We have 4 wonderful kids. I love to read, cook and bake. I also enjoy crotcheting, though I haven't had time for it lately. I currently work at Costco in Night Merchandising.</p>
        
    <p>I'm a convert to the Church since 2000 and the gospel of Jesus Christ has changed my life. I love it!</p>
